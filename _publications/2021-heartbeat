We conduct a heartbeat classification case study on the Loihi neuromorphic processor, investigating accuracy and latency optimization strategies in artificial-to-spiking neural network conversion. We present benchmarking insights with regards to spiking 1D-CNN versus artificial 1D-CNN performance on state-of-the-art neural network accelerators.
