I volunteer as a teacher of video game design with the Pitt CEC (Community Engagement Center - Hill District). 

With inspiration from this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D16hTnDGweo&list=PLy4zsTUHwGJIATydhFeZa5pspLZR7yE__&index=1), I designed a simple platformer game in Scratch, for 4-8 week instruction to kids. It covers loops, conditionals, coordinate systems, functions, etc. [Check it out!](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717808963/)
