I am Kyle, a Ph.D. student researcher in the Intelligent Systems program at the University of Pittsburgh. 

My research interests are driven towards instilling users with better confidence and trust in AI systems through improving the robustness of such systems. A primary goal of mine is to make computer vision systems more robust and understandable for use in critical application areas ranging from logistics to autonomous driving to healthcare. 

Additional AI research interests of mine include object detection, self-supervision, model generalization, and multimodal learning.

I currently work in the computer vision group with Dr. Adriana Kovashka at the University of Pittsburgh.
