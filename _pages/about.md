I am Kyle, a Ph.D. student researcher in the Intelligent Systems program at the University of Pittsburgh. 

Overall, I am interested in studying ways to ensure that object-based AI systems can effectively interpret natural language and handle common distribution shifts. 

Specific research interests of mine include:
- Vision-language modeling
- Model robustness under domain shift
- Foundational AI models
- Object detection
- Prompt learning

I currently work in the computer vision group with Dr. Adriana Kovashka at the University of Pittsburgh.
